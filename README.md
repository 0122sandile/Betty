# Betty

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holbertonschool/Betty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holbertonschool/Betty)

### Documentation

Please visit the [Betty Wiki](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) for the full specifications of Betty coding and documentation styles.

You'll also find some references and some tools for common text editors such as Emacs and Atom.

### Usage

Run the following command to check if your code/doc fits the Betty Style (mostly inspired from the Linux Kernel style):

```ShellSession
./betty-style.pl <your_file(s)>
```

```ShellSession
./betty-doc.pl <your_file(s)>
```

### Atom editor

Here's [a package](https://atom.io/packages/linter-betty) for Atom to check Betty-style code and documentation

Here's [a package](https://atom.io/packages/kernel-docstring) for Atom to generate Betty-style documentation for your C functions
